# Fast Forward:

The life of a computer science student is filled with a lot of programming languages, frameworks, mathematical knowledge, concepts. 
I feel that lifetime of a particular library is small and most of the knowledge gained is transient. 
To avoid this, I created a repository which contains initial knowledge about several programming languages. 
I can come back whenever I want and revisit the wisdom I gained earlier.
